# UESTC-Doctoral-Dissertation-Latex-file-
The UESTC Thesis overleaf version available to postgraduate International Students has been reported to have some bugs by the students, making it difficult for international doctoral students to cope with all the necessary formatting. Therefore, as part of my final doctoral dissertation, I addressed bugs and re-organized the UESTC doctoral dissertation latex file.
